## Document Organization and Folders

Create a clear structure for your documentation using folders and subfolders. You nest documents logically, like `api/reference` or `guides/advanced`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to your workspace root. Click the new folder icon and name it `features`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Document" icon="file-plus">
    Inside the folder, create a new MDX file named `authentication.mdx`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rearrange" icon="move">
    Drag folders to reorder or nest them dynamically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming like `{kebab-case}` for folders to improve navigation.

## Collaboration and Permissions

Invite team members and set granular permissions. You control who views, edits, or admins documents.

| Role       | View | Edit | Admin |
|------------|------|------|-------|
| Viewer     | ✅   | ❌   | ❌    |
| Editor     | ✅   | ✅   | ❌    |
| Admin      | ✅   | ✅   | ✅    |

<Callout kind="alert">
  Always review permissions before sharing sensitive docs to prevent unauthorized access.
</Callout>

To add a collaborator:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/workspaces/{workspaceId}/invites \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "role": "editor"}'
```

## Search and Version Control

Search across all documents with full-text indexing. Track changes via version history.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Basic Search" default-open="true">
    Use the global search bar to query terms like "authentication".

    ```javascript
    // API example
    const results = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs/search?q=auth');
    ```
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Version History">
    View diffs and restore previous versions.

    Each edit creates a commit-like snapshot. Compare changes side-by-side.
  </Expandable>
